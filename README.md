# VGG-19-StyleTransfer

Style transfer using pretrained VGG19 model. Use the google colab version, it's much easier to upload images, plus you can enable GPU or TPU runtimes which makes things go a lot faster.
Original can be found at the link below. Slight modifications were made to make image selection easier, as well as bumping a few things from TensorFlow 1.0 to TensorFlow 2.0
